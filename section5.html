            EASSy is a 10,000km submarine fibre-optic cable system deployed along the east and south coast of Africa to service
            the
            voice, data, video and internet needs of the region. It links South Africa with Sudan via landing points in
            Mozambique,
            Madagascar, the Comoros, Tanzania, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti. The cable incorporates the latest developments in
            submarine fibre-optic technology, making it economical to connect the eastern and southern coast of Africa into the
            high-speed global telecommunications network. The system is owned and operated by a group of 16 African (92%) and
            international (8%) telecommunications operators and service providers.
